# Company Case Study Description 

We have identified a new potential facility to expand and relocate our Miami operations. The site is 30,000 net sqft of usable space, and requires a design construction build-out to fit our operation. You are tasked with making a recomendation to leadership on how to allocate space in this new potential site to ensure we have suficient room to run and grow our Miami operations, taking into account key learnings from our past development project in Market X. 
Leadership wants to know based on our current production capacity in Miami and the latest growth projections, whats the maximum capacity this new potential site can handle in terms of meal production. This week Miami broke its record and produced 13,000 meals on its busiest day of the week. We expect our current facility in Miami to max out by the end of 2024, doubling its volume from current levels by end of year. The CFO reports Miami will double in size again in 2025 and then grow 40% in 2026, and 30% YoYfrom 2027-2030.
Meanwhile our largest investor wants to understand how much ARR can be generated from this new potential facility, and how long we can operate out of it until our growth surpases its maximum capacity. Leadership has asked you a summary table and/or visual representation of how capacity (meals and ARR) would play out starting on the target grand opening date for this new site (Jan 2025) until it reaches the max potential output you've calculated so they can show investors how much runway we can extract form this space.
Use the below data from Market X which underwent a similar facility development investment to make your recomendations. Remember that Market X is currently having capacity issues that are being discovered due to potentially having allocated the wrong amount of space to key areas of the operations that impact our ability to produce meals like prep and cook station square footage. The CEO is particularly intererest in improving the space allocation ratios so we dont run into similar capacity blockers again.
Point out any assumptions you make and about your calculations or the data you use.

# Overview
This case study analyzes the capacity constraints and financial implications of Cook Unity's proposed Miami production facility. The analysis reveals significant production limitations that would result in substantial revenue losses if not addressed through strategic space reallocation and capacity optimization.


# Key Findings 
-Bottom Line Up Front

- Revenue at Risk: $1.22 billion cumulative ARR loss (2025-2030) due to capacity constraints
- Immediate Action Required: Facility requires 4.9% capacity increase through space reallocation
- Alternative Strategy: Satellite locations recommended as viable solution

# Critical Metrics 
- ARR per Meal: $13.74
- Current Maximum Capacity: 58,320 meals/week
- Projected Demand (Jan 2025): 52,000 meals/day
- Capacity Shortfall: Facility can only meet 40.3% of projected 2025 demand

# Facility Analysis

Current Layout Constraints

- Total Space: 30,000 sq ft
- Production Space: 26,600 sq ft
- Space-to-Meal Ratio: 2.19 sq ft per meal
- Peak Production: 2.92 days per week

# Optimized Layout Benefits

- Additional Production Space: +1,300 sq ft (reallocated from office areas)
- Increased Weekly Capacity: +2,851 meals/week
- New Maximum Capacity: 61,171 meals/week
- Capacity Improvement: 4.9%

# Financial Impact

# Strategic Recommendations

1. Space Optimization

- Reallocate non-priority office space to production areas
- Focus on prep cook and kitchen cold storage expansion
- Maximize existing 30K sq ft footprint efficiency

2. Alternative Solutions

- Satellite locations for distributed production capacity
- Hybrid model combining optimized Miami facility with satellite operations
- Phased expansion approach to meet growing demand

3. Capacity Planning

- Immediate implementation of space reallocation plan
- Long-term facility expansion or additional locations
- Production efficiency optimization to maximize output per sq ft

# Executive Summary 

While space optimization can improve capacity by 4.9%, the fundamental constraint requires either significant facility expansion or a distributed satellite location strategy to capture the full market opportunity and avoid $1.2B in lost revenue over six years.
